# MH Travel — Implementation Worklog

## 1. Product foundation and visual direction

- Project stack is Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Lucide icons, and custom Language/Currency/Theme hooks.
- Base visual direction is a dark travel platform UI with blue accents, red action/price accents, compact cards, responsive layouts, and bilingual Burmese/English text.
- Shared listing/content cards are designed to show rating, distance, favorites, and views.
- Home uses the full footer; inner pages use the copyright-only footer.
- Mobile header keeps Menu, MH Travel, Search, and Notifications; account access is placed in the mobile sidebar footer.
- Mobile sidebar uses a partial-width drawer and renders fixed overlays through a portal.
- User-provided visual references are followed for Home, restaurant, bookstore, compact travel cards, and the `/cities` discovery sections.

## 2. Completed traveler-facing pages

### Home

- Home page includes categories, travel plans, travel guide, blogs, popular hotels/listings, reviews, awards, partners, ad slots, and full footer sections.
- Travel Guide and Popular cards were resized and aligned to the compact shared card system.
- Local Myanmar photography is used across Travel Plan, Travel Guide, Blog, and Popular cards.
- Home ad positions use the shared `AdSlot` component and collapse when no ad is available.

### Blogs

- Bilingual blog listing and article reader are implemented in `src/features/blogs/BlogsPage.tsx`.
- Compact image-led cards replaced oversized story panels.
- User-facing categories, tags, breadcrumbs, and unnecessary oversized intro panels were removed from the blog listing.
- Articles open inside the same web app with shareable `?story=` URLs; they are not displayed as a separate paper-like page.
- Favorite, share, view count, rating, and distance display are supported.
- Distance is shown only after browser geolocation permission is granted.
- A compact listing banner is shown where the removed intro text used to be.
- Related stories are shown below an article before related hotels.
- Blog post ads are supported through shared ad slots.
- All blog labels, reader labels, and actions support Burmese/English.

### Travel Plans

- Search, duration filter, sorting, compact route cards, price display, and favorite toggles are implemented.
- Custom Plan builder lets users choose starting point, destinations from MH Travel data, days, travelers, nationality, budget, transport, accommodation, hotel choice, and notes.
- Hotel selection can be left for later.
- Custom Plan requests describe the MH Travel quotation flow: MH Travel reviews the request, calculates the cost, contacts the user, and negotiates destinations/services.
- The page intentionally avoids the removed large intro/filter copy and ends with the detailed custom-plan builder.

### Nearby

- Location-aware Nearby page includes search, category grouping, rating filters, distance filters, closest results, and recommended higher-rated results.
- Location permission state is handled explicitly; fallback messaging exists when location is unavailable.

### Account and Notifications

- Traveler Account Dashboard includes overview, bookings, custom plans, favorites, reviews, messages, settings, support/legal, recent activity, and logout.
- Account logout now clears the shared session/local storage state and redirects to `/login`.
- Notifications has a full page, read/unread filters, and account activity integration.

### Restaurants and Book Shops

- Restaurant detail page follows the supplied layout reference while preserving the MH Travel shell.
- Restaurant detail includes hero, info row, map/amenities, menu tabs, dishes, reviews, venue photos, nearby attractions, and CTA.
- Book Shop detail page follows the supplied reference layout with services, photos, popular books, nearby attractions, and CTA.

## 3. Authentication UI and session behavior

### Traveler routes

- `/login` is a dedicated traveler Login page.
- `/signup` is a dedicated traveler Signup page.
- Login and Signup are not shown as tabs in one combined form anymore.
- Signup fields are Username, Display name, Gmail/Email, Password, and Confirm password.
- Phone number is intentionally not requested.
- Username validation allows lowercase English letters, numbers, and underscores, with a 3–24 character limit.
- Login accepts either Username or Gmail/Email plus password.
- User Login does not expose Super Admin preview credentials or an Admin shortcut.
- Google and Facebook signup buttons use recognizable inline brand-style SVG icons.
- OAuth buttons are currently visual entry points and will be activated after Supabase provider credentials and callback URLs are configured.

### Session and navigation

- `src/lib/auth.tsx` currently provides a local preview session store with traveler and `super_admin` roles.
- Desktop Header and Mobile Menu react to the shared auth state.
- Traveler account logout clears the session and returns to traveler Login.
- Super Admin logout clears the session and returns to `/admin/login`.

### Supabase Auth connection started

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` now exposes a nullable configured client so builds without environment variables still work in preview.
- The shared auth provider now hydrates Supabase sessions, listens to `onAuthStateChange`, supports Supabase email signup/login, and calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` on logout.
- Signup sends `username` and `display_name` metadata so the `public.profiles` trigger can create the linked profile.
- Google and Facebook buttons now call `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth()` with a callback to the Login route.
- Admin login checks the linked profile role before allowing the Super Admin portal.
- The implementation was typechecked and production-built successfully.
- Supabase Dashboard provider credentials are still required before Google/Facebook OAuth can complete in production; this remains an external configuration blocker.
- Facebook App credentials were supplied, but Supabase Dashboard login/hCaptcha prevented provider configuration; setup was intentionally deferred at the user's request. The secret is not stored in the repository or Plan notes.

## 4. Super Admin Portal

- Super Admin does not use the traveler web shell.
- `/admin/login` is a standalone Admin Login page without traveler Header, navigation, or Footer.
- `/super-admin` is protected:
  - unauthenticated visitors redirect to `/admin/login`;
  - traveler accounts redirect to `/account`;
  - only `super_admin` sessions can see the dashboard.
- Super Admin sees the dashboard only, not the traveler website pages.
- Dashboard includes overview metrics, recent activity, users, content/listings, bookings, settings, role notes, and quick actions.
- A clearly labeled `Logout / ထွက်မည်` button is visible in the dashboard header and returns to `/admin/login`.

## 5. Supabase backend work completed

- Supabase project: `mhtravelmm` (`ewuvxowujkbyvftoihxh`).
- Migration applied: `create_user_profiles_and_auth_policies`.
- Follow-up migration applied: `allow_super_admin_role_management`.
- `public.profiles` table exists with:
  - `id uuid` referencing `auth.users(id)` with cascade delete;
  - unique nullable `username`;
  - `display_name`;
  - `role` with traveler/admin role checks;
  - `avatar_url`;
  - `created_at` and `updated_at`.
- RLS is enabled on `public.profiles`.
- Own-profile select/insert/update policies and Super Admin management policies are present.
- Auth-user signup trigger automatically creates a profile and derives a safe username from metadata/email when needed.
- Role-change trigger blocks traveler self-escalation and allows Super Admin role management.
- Current Supabase profile row count was zero because no real user account details were provided yet.
- Two Supabase migrations were applied to create the profile schema and then allow verified Super Admin role management. The Plan folder records what those migrations did and their current status; SQL source files are intentionally not stored in Plan.
